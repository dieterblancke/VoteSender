# VoteSender #

VoteSender is a simple & lightweight plugin that allows you to send votes (received by (Nu)Votifier) to other (Nu)Votifier servers.

## Dependencies ##
VoteSender requires the following in order to run:

* Java 8 
+ Last (Paper)Spigot version 
- NuVotifier (or Votifier 1.9)

## Important ##
**Never** enter the Votifier settings of the server in which VoteSender is installed, this **will** cause **an endless vote loop**.
This means that VoteSender will create a vote loop making votes continously send to all your servers installed in VoteSender.

## Commands ##
For all commands, the permission **votesend.admin** is required!

* /votesend reload 
+ /votesend send (player) (service) 
- /votesend help
